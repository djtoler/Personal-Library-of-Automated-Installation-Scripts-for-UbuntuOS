##Part2 (Docker on AWS)

INSTALL DOCKER

    Now that we have our code stored on GitHub, we can containerize our app using Docker. 

    SO in our IDE, the first thing we can do is install Docker so that we can build our container and push it to DockerHub. 

    DockerHub is fundemntally the same as GitHub but instead of storing code, we store containers images. 

    So a container is like a ready to use, out-of-the-box version of our application code and everythinig our application needs to run. 

    So a container image is a file that lists where to get our application code from and whatever else we need for our application to run.

    Now we'll install Docker. I got to GirHub to get my installation script. 
        https://github.com/djtoler/Personal-Library-of-Automated-Installation-Scripts-for-UbuntuOS/blob/main/auto-docker_install.sh

    I go to the raw file and copy the link.

    I download it onto my server and run it so that Docker can install. 

CREATE DOCKER FILE (Build the TV dinner recipe list)

    Then we create our Dockerfile. I'll download and install that the same way
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djtoler/Personal-Library-of-Automated-Installation-Scripts-for-UbuntuOS/main/Dockerfile

    FROM nginx:alpine

    RUN git clone https://github.com/djtoler/hwthdemo.git /tmp/hwthdemo && \
        mv /tmp/hwthdemo/hwth.html ./index.html && \
        rm -rf /tmp/hwthdemo/.git

    EXPOSE 80

BUILD DOCKER IMAGE (Cook the TV dinner from the recipe and package it)

    We'll login to DockerHub with a username and a token

    We run docker login and enter our username

    Then generate a token from DockerHub for our password

    Then we'll build our image and push it to DockerHub
    docker build -t djtoler/demoapp1 .
    docker push djtoler/demoapp1:latest

    Then go to DockerHub check and make sure its stored 

RUN DOCKER CONTAINER FROM IMAGE (Microwave the TV dinner and serve it)
    docker run -d -p 80:80 djtoler/demoapp1:latest
