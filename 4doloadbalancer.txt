##Part4 (Load Balancer)

Now that we have our container up and running in digtal ocean, we can create another virtual machine and run our container with a load balancer. 

    doctl compute droplet create dk100 --size s-1vcpu-1gb --image docker-20-04 --region nyc1 --ssh-keys 41966894 --tag-names hwthdemo --wait

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djtoler/Personal-Library-of-Automated-Installation-Scripts-for-UbuntuOS/main/auto-container.sh

    

This will allow us to control where the traffic to our website goes. 

So for example, if we want to test to see which design keeps users on our app longer, we can use a load balancer to randomly split the traffic between our 2 versions.
