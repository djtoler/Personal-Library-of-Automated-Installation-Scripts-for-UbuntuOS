##Part3 (Docker on Digital Ocean)

So to run our container on digital ocean we'll make a virtual machine, download our same container image from DockerHub, run it and see why this whole container concept is important.

So the first thing we do is create a key, which is like a access code for our Virtual machine.
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "dk2" -f ~/.ssh/dk2
    cat ~/.ssh/dk2

Then we'll add our key to digital ocean
    doctl compute ssh-key import "dk2" --public-key-file ~/.ssh/dk2.pub
    doctl compute ssh-key list

Then will create our digital ocean virtual machine
    doctl compute droplet create my-docker-droplet3 --size s-1vcpu-1gb --image docker-20-04 --region nyc1 --ssh-keys 41914405 --wait

Then attach a firewall to make sure port 80 is open

Next, well connect to our virtual machine and make sure docker is installed and then login to docker

Now instead of having to build and push our docker image like we did before, we can just pull it it from DockerHub now since its already stored there.
    docker images
    docker pull djtoler/demoapp1 
    docker images

Then we can run our same container from digital ocean the same way we did on AWS
    docker run -d -p 80:80 djtoler/demoapp1:latest
