##Part5 (Jenkins)
So we explained earlier that Jenkins is a tool to help us automate the delivery of our application updates. 

Jenkinsfile is a file where we define the stages in our CICD pipeline that our code will pass through before going into production and being made available to our users. In our demo here we have 2 stages. 

First stage, we have "Pull latest code from GitHub" and this git command will pull our most recently updated code version. 

Second stage, we have "Check background color". 

This will check our appliction to make sure we dont ever push a version of our application out to our users that has a red background. 

If the background is set to the red color, our pipeline will fail and it wont push this new version of our app out to our users

We can make as many stages as we want and we can do whatever we want in those stages. 

So we might have a development enviornment where we build new features for our app. 

So lets say we add a new sign up form on our app, we can add a stage that generates a random name and email address to sign up on our app and checks the database to validate that all names and emails are getting saved.
