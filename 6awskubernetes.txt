##Part6 (Kubernetes)
So now lets say we've been using a load balancer to find test different things and we've found out exactly what our users want and now our application is getting a million users per day.

At that point Kubernetes comes in. 

Kubernetes is a container orchistration tool that apps like Reddit, AirBnB,, Tesla and eBay use. 

One of the main features Kubernets has is auto-scaling. Auto-scaling gives us the flexibility to scale our number of servers up when our application traffic increases and scale the number of servers down when our application traffic decreases.

So lets say we have a food delivery app we'll have huge traffic spikes during lunch time and dinner time. 

So for most of they day, we might only need 2 server to run our app. But during dinner hours, we might need to scale up to 10 servers.

With Kubernetes, we can set a minimum of 2 servers and maximum of 10 servers for our application. 

This way, Kubernetes will automatically increase the number of servers we based on how much traffic were getting. 

So during dinner, Kubernetes might scale us up to 9 or 10 servers but at 4am when not a lot of people are ordering food, Kubernetes would have us scaled down to only 2 servers.
